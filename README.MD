* AWS Account
* Github Account
* Desire to learn :)

Let's Go!!

# Objective

There's a lot of content on AWS Lambda out there in the wild wild west of the internet -- but a lot of it is focused on Node & Javascript, with a very small percentage focused on Python, even smaller for other languages like Java, Rust and Ruby -- but honestly nobody cares about them anyway.

This is frustrating, because while Node.JS was the first runtime to be supported when Lambda launched in 2014, Python support came just 1 year later, and we've now had 5 glorious years of Python support in Lambda -- so it's high time it gets some attention.

Python is pretty popular in AWS, the aws-cli is written in Python, more projects on AWSLabs are written in Python then are written in Java and Javascript combined!!

So what gives? Why isn't Python more popular in Lambda?

Maybe a one year head-start for something as game-changing as lambda creates a long-tail effect that last years. And, while many developers look at Javascript with derision -- it really is a slick and cool language.

But the real reason is this concept of 'Full Stack Developer', having developers being able to code front-end and back-ends is an efficient approach for teams of any size, and from a developers perspective learning just one language to do it in (Javascript), makes an enourmous amount of sense.

That doesn't mean Python isn't suited for Lambda -- it just means Javascript will always be the more popular choice for certain workloads. But as Lambda grows to become more than just an API endpoint, it enters into the world of scripting, a domain that Python historically excelled at.

So if you have existing Python knowledge and want to code in Lambda, without learning a whole new language, this is written for you.
